### What Works
- Paddles move up/down
- Ball bounces off walls and paddles
- Scores show on screen

### What's Broken
- No win condition (scores keep going)
- Sometimes ball gets stuck
- No menu or restart

### Controls
- Left player: W/S
- Right player: Up/Down arrows

*"It's playable, but needs polish"*
